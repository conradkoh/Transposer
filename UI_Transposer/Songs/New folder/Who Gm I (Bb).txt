       Bb           F               Gm
Who am I? That the Lord of all the earth,
      F               Eb           F               Eb     
Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt,
       Bb           F                  Gm
Who am I? That the Bright and Morning Star,
      F                   Eb           F              Eb 
Would choose to light the way, For my ever wandering heart,
    Gm               F       Eb                      F
Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done,
    Gm                   F         Eb                  F
Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are,


Chorus

Bb      F              Gm           F              Eb 
I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,
  F                  Eb                             Bb
G wave tossed in the ocean (ocean), a vapor in the wind,
          F                Gm                 F                 Eb 
Still You hear me when I'm calling, Lord, You catch me when I'm falling,
           F             Eb 
And You've told me who I am.. 
     Bb
I am Yours.

Verse 2
       Bb           F                Gm
Who am I? That the eyes that see my sin,
      F               Eb         F             Eb   
Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again,
       Bb           F                     Gm
Who am I? That the voice that calmed the sea,
      F                    Eb         F                 Eb    
Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me,
    Gm               F       Eb                      F
Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done,
    Gm                   F         Eb                  F
Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are,
